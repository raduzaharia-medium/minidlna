# Configuration file for MiniDLNA
This repository contains the configuration file I talk about in my [media server setup](https://raduzaharia.medium.com/how-to-setup-a-media-server-on-your-raspberry-pi-8261016515b0) tutorial on medium. I also touch on setting up a media server in [another article](https://raduzaharia.medium.com/enabling-more-services-on-your-raspberry-pi-7598b3aefb82) there.
